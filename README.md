## Job Experience
**Software Engineer (R&D)**  
Alchemy Software Limited (November 2020 – Present)  

- Developed "Chat as a Service" – a purpose-built extractive chatbot capable of processing files (PDF, TXT) and providing context-aware responses to user queries.
- Executed and managed the data lifecycle: collected, cleaned, and analyzed raw data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to extract actionable insights.
- Designed robust web scraping solutions and automated the extraction of relevant information from datasets, including specific work on CVs (e.g., BdJobs CVs).
- Fine-tuned Huggingface LLM models for diverse NLP tasks, including sentiment classification, information extraction, language translation, and topic modeling.
- Built and deployed Neural Machine Translation systems using an Encoder-Decoder architecture (e.g., English-Bangla), focusing on linguistic precision and fluency.
- Designed and created optimized, task-specific pipelines for various NLP applications (e.g., Data Cleaning, Question-Answering, Sentiment Analysis, Text Generation).
- Managed the end-to-end data process: collect, preprocess, and annotate datasets for training and evaluating NLP models.
- Worked closely with cross-functional teams to integrate NLP solutions into real-world applications, improving user experiences.

## Projects
- **Chat as a Service**: A chatbot service for tasks such as translation, paraphrasing, summarization, plagiarism detection, etc. Integrating key modules for file processing, data preprocessing, and context-aware responses.

- **Stress Level Detection**: A Comparison Study of Statistical ML Model vs Pre-difined CNN Model vs Proposed (LSTM+CNN) Model. Proposed an optimal multi-modal deep learning approach to identify the stress level from audio data. Transcribed the audio to text, extract the audio features, calculate a emotion score from text, detect the stress level using these three features.
